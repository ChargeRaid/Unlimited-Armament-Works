# Update 0.7.8
Update 0.7.8 is here, Unit renames, steam engines, and balance changes!

## What's in This Update?
A... lot, and your old save would probably dont work anymore
1. Unit Rename
	- To better fit the lore of UAW, ALL unit name has been changed (except Helicopters), it'll no more uses names taken from another language other than english.
	- This also means, that translation wouldn't work and would be very misleading also.
2. Steam Engines
	- Pretty self explanatory, structures that utilize a steam to power them, complete with way of boiling water to get steam, the gas pipes, crafter, drills, and more!
	- All of this structures are available on the tech tree, you can access them as soon as you researched the "Mechanical Pump"	.
3. Anthracite
	- Anthracite before was a pretty much worthless material, it now can be used to power boilers which used for getting steam.
	- Anthracite can now be only aquired by drilling coal using a special drill called "Steam Thumper".
4. Carburizing Furnace
	- Carburizing Furnace is now a part of the brand new steam engines tech tree.
5. Unit Factories & Oil Derrick
	- Oil Derrick will now also be a part of the brand new steam engines tech tree, and UAW modded unit factories will require Oil Derrick to be researched also.
6. Liquid Cistern
	- A new block for storing liquid, bigger storage capacity than liquid tanks
7. Tier 5 Ground Unit - Main Battle Tank - 'Caernarvon'
