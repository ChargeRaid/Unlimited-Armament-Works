# Update 0.7.8
Update 0.7.8 is here, Unit renames, steam engines, and balance changes!

## What's in This Update?
A... lot, and your old save would probably don't work anymore
1. Unit Rename
	- To better fit the lore of UAW, ALL unit name has been changed (except Helicopters), it'll no more use names taken from another language other than English.
	- This also means, that translation wouldn't work and would be very misleading also.
2. Steam Engines
	- Pretty self-explanatory, structures that utilize steam to power them, complete with a way of boiling water to get steam, the gas pipes, crafter, drills, and more!
	- All of these structures are available on the tech tree, you can access them as soon as you researched the "Mechanical Pump".
3. Anthracite
	- Anthracite before was a pretty much worthless material, it now can be used to power boilers which are used for getting steam.
	- Anthracite can now be only acquired by drilling coal using a special drill called "Steam Thumper".
4. Carburizing Furnace
	- Carburizing Furnace is now a part of the brand new steam engines tech tree.
5. Unit Factories & Oil Derrick
	- Oil Derrick will now also be a part of the brand new steam engines tech tree, and UAW modded unit factories will require Oil Derrick to be researched also.
6. Liquid Cistern
	- A new block for storing liquid, bigger storage capacity than liquid tanks
7. Petroleum Generator
	- Got yeeted into the oblivion / removed
8. Tier 5 Ground Unit - Main Battle Tank - 'Caernarvon'

Its main gun shells completely bypass enemy force shields and most of their unit's armor. It's also heavily armored and slightly faster than its predecessor.
9. Balance Changes for units that I definitely forgot to document, so you have to figure it out yourself
